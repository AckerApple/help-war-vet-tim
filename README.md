# help-war-vet-tim
A programmers public approach to find monetary support for a war veteran very much in need of assistance

## Goals
- Help war vet Tim move closer to his daughter in GA
- Raise 45k in donations
  - 42k for the 25% of 165k home loan
  - Nearly 18k closing costs + moving costs
  - Tim already has 15k
- Clean an properly provide collected funds at time of need

## Potential Donation Platforms to Research
- Wounded Warrior Project
  - Seems mostly about taking donations. Resources seem to exist for putting that money to use
  - Google "wounded warrior ways to ask for assistance"
  - Learn more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Warrior_Project
- [indigodonations](https://indigodonations.com)
  - Seems to be a general donation platform. Need to learn more
- [GoFundMe.com](https://www.gofundme.com/)
  - Seems the most popular and perhaps where we drive donations into
  - Need to learn how accounts and funds control works
- Social Platforms
  - Once we have a defined direction for donated funds to flow we can leverage social media
  - Facebook

## General Research Needs
- Research donation platforms
- Ensure clear legitmacy
  - Clear seperation of outside funds for campaign separate from funds collected
    - Currently, campaign efforts are all funded by Acker Apple
  - Document Everything
- Ensure very clear destination of funds and final extraction
  - What happens if we don't reach goal
  - When do we expire campaign and just give Tim the funds
- Maybe create YouTube video


## Originally Provided Call for Action
I would like to say thank you up front for any help or information that you may give. I am a 100% disabled combat veteran that needs help in purchasing a home closer to our daughter in GA. We are no longer allowed to use any government backed loan again. When I owned my company, I took out an SBA loan to expand the company portfolio. Unfortunately, 10 months after getting this money I fell ill, due to my war injuries, became bedridden for over 8 years that was to the extent of a nurse coming in to feed and bathe me. It is degrading enough to have a go through something like this, but for the government to turn their back on me yet again hurts. Needless to say, I was forced to close my company and default on the SBA loan. I am looking to get a home with a price of $165,000. I have $15,000 of our own money, but need to ask for any assistance possible to get the remainder of the deposit and if possible to help cover moving expenses. Anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated.
